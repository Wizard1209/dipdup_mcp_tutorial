# ERC20 Token Indexer with AI Integration

Index Ethereum ERC20 tokens and interact with the data using natural language.

## What It Does

- Tracks ERC20 token transfers on Ethereum
- Lets AI agents add new tokens to track
- Enables querying transfers by address
- Everything works through simple language commands

## Scenaries

Track USDC transfers, ask perplexity for correct contract address and from which block to start indexer. Add transfers index. Answer very briefly.
